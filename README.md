## Incentive

<<<<<<< HEAD
We wanted to create an app where you can find and get to know everything related to covid-19 situation from getting stats to buying masks,sanitizers.
People in rural areas can use our app as it is simple and has a very user friendly interface. Due to extremely high occupancy doctors
are treating non-covid patients only if it's an emergency. CRA will give them confidence as they can contact our doctor through our app.
CRA contains all the symptoms that relate to Covid-19 to make the public precautious.

Common citizens who in some situations have to move out of their houses to get masks, sanitizers can buy and also know where the red zones exist
nearby to their location and respectively can take necessary precautions. We added a payment method using ether(cryptocurrency), people are able to pay through their smartphones.
