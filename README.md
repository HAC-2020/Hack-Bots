## Incentive

The doctors and policemen are working for us day and night. Taking example of metropolitan cities such as Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bangalore
many policemen and doctors have been affected by coronavirus just because they were helping us. Keeping in mind, we didn't want to make them
taking any chances. Hence, our app can make the people who are volunteering or working with covid-19 aware of where 
there is high number of cases and where should they take uttermost precautions. 

People in rural areas and even people who are not literate can use our app. Due to extremely high occupancy doctors
are treating non-covid patients only if it's an emergency. CRA will give them confidence as they can contact nearby doctors through our app.
CRA contains all the symptoms that relate to Covid-19 to make the public precautious.

Common citizens who in some situations have to move out of their houses to buy groceries can know where the red zones exist
and respectively can take necessary precautions. Due to the E-Payment apps, people are able to pay through their smartphones.

## What do we come up with?

### CRA

CRA has the following Capabilities:
1.In CRA, we were able to link ethereum with our app. Ethereum is second largest cryptocurrency with a scope to grow larger in the upcoming bright days.
People after communicating with doctors can pay through ethereum which directly is linked to their wallet to buy
masks and sanitizers through our app.

2.Our app is not only confined to the graduates but also to everyone with no difficulties.

3.One can get to know the precautions and get educated about the disease. In this way we are ensuring the safety and health of users.
